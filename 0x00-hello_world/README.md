## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement C programming

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
## C
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the `Betty` style linter.
## Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
To get started with this project, do the following:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pritchad25/alx-low_level_programming.git`
2. Access the project directory: `cd 0x00-hello_world`
3. Run any 1 of the executable files or scripts in the directory.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
- You can run any of the executable files or scripts in this directory to see what they output. Just as an example, the script `1-compiler` compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name is saved in the variable `$CFILE`
