## About <a name="about"></a>
This repository contains contains all the Low Level Programming projects that were done at the ALX Software Engineering School

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this First Trimester, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why C programming is awesome
- how to use the different Control Structures in C programming
- What pointers are and their relationship with Strings and Arrays in the C Language
- The Significance of C pointers as applied today in Algorithmic problems
- How To use Recursion to solve complex problems regarding functions
- What C Static Libraries and Dynamic Libraries are
- How to pass and manipulate arguments in the C main function using argc and argv
- The Importance of Memory Allocation and Memory Freeing in programming
- The Components of the C preprocessor and how they link to each other.
- What C Structures are and how to implement them
- What function pointers and variadic functions are and how to use them
- How to implement Bit Manipulation in C
- How to implement core Data Structures such as Singly & Double Linked Lists and Hash Tables in the C programming Language
- How to implement Linux & Unix functionalities such as File I/O and Make-Files in C programming Language

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style linter, ie, they should be Betty Compliant
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
