This directory contains solutions to the programming tasks of the C Makefiles Project done at ALX Software Engineering School.
While doing this project, I learnt:
-What make Makefiles are
-When, why and how to use Makefiles
-What rules are and how to set and use them
-What explicit and implicit rules are
-What the most common or useful rules are.
-What variables are and how to set and use them
