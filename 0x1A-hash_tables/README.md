## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement the Hash Tables Data Structure using the C programming language.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a hash function
- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style linter.
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `hash_tables.h`
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
