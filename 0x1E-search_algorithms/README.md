This directory contains solutions to the programming tasks of the C Search Algorithms project done at the ALX Software Engineering School.While doing this project, I learnt:
-What a search algorithm is
-What a linear search is
-What a binary search is
-What the best search algorithm is to be used depending on my needs.
